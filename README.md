Welcome to my python intermediate project.

I have created a python program which takes the symbol of a stock company as an input and directly retrieves the data through the package 'yfinance'. It then provides 
visualizations including the line graph of closing prices, graph of volumes, correlation matrice of the companies etc. I have also included the prediction of the 
closing price using Linear Regression. Since this is a intermediate level project, intensive machine learning methods are not included. Due to the limitations of 
linear regression, the prediction is not very much accurate.

In this project, I have covered the following:
- Object-oriented Programming
- Error Handling
- File processing
